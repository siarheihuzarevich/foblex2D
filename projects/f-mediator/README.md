# Foblex2D

An Angular library for 2D geometric computations, providing classes and utilities for manipulating points, lines, vectors, rectangles, arcs, and transformations. 
Used in [Foblex Flow](https://flow.foblex.com) for 2D geometric operations.

## Overview

The Foblex2D library is designed to simplify 2D geometric operations in TypeScript and Angular applications. It offers a rich set of classes and utility functions for:

- **Geometric Primitives**: Points, Lines, Vectors, Rectangles, Arcs, and Rounded Rectangles.
- **Geometric Calculations**: Distance, angle, intersection detection, and transformations.
- **Transformations**: Handling position, scaling, and rotation transformations.
- **Intersection Detection**: Finding intersections between line segments and various shapes, including rounded rectangles and arcs.

Whether youâ€™re building graphical editors, games, data visualization tools, or any application that requires precise 2D geometric computations, Foblex2D provides the tools you need.

## Installation

Install the library via npm:

```bash
  npm install @foblex/2D
```
## Usage

### Working with Points

Create and manipulate points:

```typescript
import { Point, PointExtensions } from '@foblex/2D';

// Using the Point class
const pointA = new Point(10, 20);
const pointB = new Point(30, 40);

// Using PointExtensions for utility functions
const sumPoint = pointA.add(pointB);
const distance = PointExtensions.distance(pointA, pointB);

console.log(`Sum Point: (${sumPoint.x}, ${sumPoint.y})`);
console.log(`Distance between points: ${distance}`);
```

### Working with Lines

Create and manipulate lines:

```typescript
import { Line, LineExtensions } from '@foblex/2D';

const point1 = new Point(0, 0);
const point2 = new Point(10, 10);

const line = new Line(point1, point2);

// Calculate the length of the line
const length = LineExtensions.hypotenuse(line);

console.log(`Line length: ${length}`);
```

### Vector Operations

Perform vector calculations:

```typescript
import { VectorExtensions } from '@foblex/2D';

const vector1 = VectorExtensions.initialize(1, 0);
const vector2 = VectorExtensions.initialize(0, 1);

// Calculate the angle between two vectors
const angleRadians = VectorExtensions.angle(vector1, vector2);
const angleDegrees = (angleRadians * 180) / Math.PI;

console.log(`Angle between vectors: ${angleDegrees} degrees`);
```

### Working with Rectangles

Create and manipulate rectangles:

```typescript
import { RectExtensions, IRect, Point } from '@foblex/2D';

// Initialize a rectangle
const rect = RectExtensions.initialize(0, 0, 100, 50);

// Check if a point is inside the rectangle
const point = new Point(50, 25);
const isInside = RectExtensions.isIncludePoint(rect, point);

console.log(`Point is inside rectangle: ${isInside}`);
```

### Handling Transformations

Work with transformations:

```typescript
import { ITransformModel, TransformModelExtensions } from '@foblex/2D';

const transform = TransformModelExtensions.default();
transform.position = { x: 100, y: 50 };
transform.scale = 2;

// Get the transformation matrix string
const transformString = TransformModelExtensions.toString(transform);

console.log(`Transform Matrix: ${transformString}`);
```

### Finding Intersections

Detect intersections between lines and shapes:

```typescript
import { IntersectionFinder, RoundedRect, Point } from '@foblex/2D';

const fromPoint = new Point(0, 0);
const toPoint = new Point(150, 150);

const roundedRect = new RoundedRect(50, 50, 100, 100, 20, 20, 20, 20);

const intersections = IntersectionFinder.getIntersections(fromPoint, toPoint, roundedRect);

if (intersections.length > 0) {
  intersections.forEach((point, index) => {
    console.log(`Intersection ${index + 1}: (${point.x}, ${point.y})`);
  });
} else {
  console.log('No intersections found.');
}
```
